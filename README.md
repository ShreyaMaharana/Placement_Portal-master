# Placement_Portal-master
 A Collage Placement Portal on GitHub would be a web-based platform designed to streamline the college placement process. The portal could provide:  Student Profiles: Students can upload resumes, skills, academic records, and certifications. Job Listings: Companies can post job openings with detailed descriptions, requirements, and deadlines. Application Tracking: Students can track their applications, receive interview invites, and get updates. Admin Dashboard: Admins can manage users, job postings, and monitor placement statistics. Analytics: Insights into placement success rates, student performance, and employer engagement. Integration with GitHub would allow for open-source collaboration, version control, and easy deployment.
